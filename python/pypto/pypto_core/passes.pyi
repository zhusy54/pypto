    This pass traverses all TileType variables in each Function and creates alloc operations
    for each unique MemRef. The alloc operations are added at the beginning of the function.

    The pass performs the following steps:
    1. Identifies all TileType variables in the function
    2. Collects all unique MemRef objects from these TileType variables
    3. Creates an alloc operation for each unique MemRef
    4. Prepends these alloc operations to the function body

def convert_to_ssa() -> Pass:

    This pass converts non-SSA IR to SSA form by:
    1. Renaming variables with version suffixes (x -> x_0, x_1, x_2)
    2. Adding phi nodes (return_vars + YieldStmt) for IfStmt control flow divergence
    3. Converting loop-modified variables to iter_args + return_vars pattern

    The pass handles:
    - Straight-line code: multiple assignments to the same variable
    - If statements: variables modified in one or both branches
    - For loops: variables modified inside the loop body
    - Mixed SSA/non-SSA: preserves existing SSA structure while converting non-SSA parts

    Returns:

def outline_incore_scopes() -> Pass:
    """Create a pass that outlines InCore scopes into separate functions.

    This pass transforms ScopeStmt(InCore) nodes into separate Function(InCore) definitions
    and replaces the scope with a Call to the outlined function.

    Requirements:
    - Input IR must be in SSA form (run convert_to_ssa first)
    - Only processes Opaque functions (InCore functions are left unchanged)

    Transformation:
    1. For each ScopeStmt(InCore) in an Opaque function:
       - Analyze body to determine external variable references (inputs)
       - Analyze body to determine internal definitions used after scope (outputs)
       - Extract body into new Function(InCore) with appropriate params/returns

    1. Call arguments cannot be calls
    2. If conditions cannot be calls
    3. For loop ranges (start/stop/step) cannot be calls
    4. Binary/unary expression operands cannot be calls

    Nested calls are extracted into temporary variables (named _t0, _t1, etc.)
    and inserted as AssignStmt before the statement containing the nested call.
    For if/for statements, extracted statements are inserted into the last OpStmts
    before the if/for, or a new OpStmts is created if needed.

    Example transformation:
        c = foo(bar(a))  =>  _t0 = bar(a); c = foo(_t0)

    This pass ensures IR is in a normalized form:
    1. Function/IfStmt/ForStmt body must be SeqStmts

    Example transformations:
        Function body = AssignStmt(x, 1)

    """

def flatten_single_stmt() -> Pass:
    """Create a pass that recursively flattens single-statement blocks.

    This pass simplifies IR by removing unnecessary nesting:
    - SeqStmts with only one statement is replaced by that statement
    - OpStmts with only one statement is replaced by that statement
    - Process is applied recursively

    Example transformations:
        SeqStmts([OpStmts([AssignStmt(x, 1)])])
        => AssignStmt(x, 1)

        SeqStmts([OpStmts([AssignStmt(x, 1), AssignStmt(y, 2)])])

    Note: This pass does NOT enforce that Function/IfStmt/ForStmt body must be SeqStmts.
