    This pass traverses all TileType variables in each Function and creates alloc operations

    1. Identifies all TileType variables in the function

    3. Creates an alloc operation for each unique MemRef

    3. Converting loop-modified variables to iter_args + return_vars pattern

    The pass handles:
    - Straight-line code: multiple assignments to the same variable
    - If statements: variables modified in one or both branches
    - For loops: variables modified inside the loop body
